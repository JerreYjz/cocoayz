These are scripts for training the emulators.

cmbemutrfhsevangit.py: training python script that the users can modify and use as job scripts.

CMB-emulator-tutorial notebook: This notebook is a short tutorial for training emulators. It contains information about how to modify the architectures
and how to set up training.

CMB-emulator-TRF-testing-tutorial notebook: This note book is a short tutorial for testing trained Transformer emulators. It contains functions for using the trained
emulators for prediction, and how to test the model in general. 

CMB-ResNet-testing-tutorial notebook: This note book is a short tutorial for testing trained ResNet emulators. It contains functions for using the trained
emulators for prediction, including the inverse PCA transformation process, and how to test the model in general.
