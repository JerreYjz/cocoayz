CMBunidv.py: The python code for MPI run generation of data vectors from CAMB.

CMBunidv.sh: The sbatch file for MPIrun+OpenMP setting of the python jobs in servers. The example here is written for Seawulf supercomputer
in Stony Brook University. Users need to modify it to adapt to the servers in their own institutes.
